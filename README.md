A game I made in 48 hours as part of [Global Game Jam 2022](https://globalgamejam.org/), with the theme **Duality**.

## Description

This game combines elements of the popular game *"Would you Rather?"* with the mechanics of a Top-Down shooter.
You must kill enemies in order to upgrade your character, but every ***"upgrade"*** to your character comes with a **consequence**.
You must chose what consequences you can survive as you upgrade your Tank in the goal of lasting in the harsh world.
